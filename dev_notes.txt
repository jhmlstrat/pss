undo undo moves?

how to handle in-game moves
	- seems best as situation buttons
        - and defensive panel (how to display PH/PR??) (Need lineup on side?)

If initial date = today supply start time (server-side)

Mid series trades

- 1 Finish funky input
- 2 Finish substitution
- 3 2021 setup (complete?)

Add per inning to situation
